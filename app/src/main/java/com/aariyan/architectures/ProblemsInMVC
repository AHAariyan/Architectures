1. Tight Coupling
The TaskListView is tightly coupled with the Controller.
UI updates (tasks.value) rely on manual intervention, making code harder to maintain.
2. Manual State Management
The tasks list in the View is not reactive. Each update requires explicitly re-fetching data from the Controller.
3. Scalability Issues
Adding more features like filtering tasks would make the Controller and View more complex and intertwined.
4. Lack of Reactive UI
Jetpack Compose is designed for reactive UIs, but MVC's reliance on manual updates contradicts Composeâ€™s principles.
